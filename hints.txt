TESTING 
It's not alwways easy to know what files you need to test and what can help in cases like that is to use the package called 'coverage'.

1. To use coverage => pip install coverage
COMMANDS TO RUN coverage
- coverage run manage.py test
- coverage report
- coverage html
2. run "coverage report" to give you full report of what files that needs to be tested 

However, you cam ommit the files that's not created by you. 
- run - coverage run --omit='*/env/*' manage.py test

Django livereload command 
1. Install package: pip install django-livereload-server
2. Add 'livereload' to the INSTALLED_APPS, before 'django.contrib.staticfiles'
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'livereload',
    ...
)
3. Next you need to inject the loading of the livereload javascript. You can do this in one of two ways:

Through middleware by adding 'livereload.middleware.LiveReloadScript' to MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES (probably at the end):

MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
    ...
    'livereload.middleware.LiveReloadScript',
)
Usage:

keep the livereload server running.

Start the django development server as usual (in another console):

$ python manage.py runserver
In the browser's address bar access your web app by doing:
python manage.py livereload
